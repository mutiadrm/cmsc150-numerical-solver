**This project includes:**
- Quadratic Spline Interpolation Solver
    - Input: CSV file containing the data points, real number x
    - Output: Function per interval, an estimate of f(x)
    
- Polynomial Regression Solver 
    - Input: CSV file containing the data points, real number x, order n
    - Output: nth order function that will model the data, an estimate of f(x)

- Simplex Solver
    - Problem: 
        ASSESSING THE VALUE OF SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT OPTIMIZING SHIPMENTS
One of the main products of the Fairway Woods Company is custom-made golf clubs. The clubs are
manufactured at three plants (Denver, Colorado; Phoenix, Arizona; and Dallas, Texas) and are then shipped
by truck to five distribution warehouses in Sacramento, California; Salt Lake City, Utah; Albuquerque, New
Mexico; Chicago, Illinois; and New York City, New York. Because shipping costs are a major expense,
management is investigating a way to reduce them. For the upcoming golf season, an estimate has been
created as to the total output needed from each manufacturing plant and how each warehouse will require
satisfying its customers. The CIO from Fairway Woods Company has created a spreadsheet of the shipping
costs from each manufacturing plant to each warehouse as a baseline analysis.
    - Main goal: Minimize total shipping cost
    - Restrictions:
        - Total shipped must be less than or equal to supply at the plant.
        - Total shipped to warehouses must be greater than or equal to demand at warehouses.
        - The number to ship must be greater than or equal to 0.
